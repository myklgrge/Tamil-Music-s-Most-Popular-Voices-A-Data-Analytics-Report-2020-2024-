# 🎵 Tamil Music Streaming Analysis (2020–2024)

##  Overview

This project explores the **streaming trends of Tamil songs from 2020 to 2024**, focusing on the **gender of the singers** behind the most-streamed tracks. It was born out of curiosity:  
> *Who sings the songs we hear the most — and are there noticeable patterns across male, female, and duet-led tracks?*

##  Key Highlights
- ✅ Explored 250 top-streamed Tamil songs across 5 years
- ✅ Classified singers by gender (Male, Female, Duet)
- ✅ Analyzed song popularity using SQL
- ✅ Visualized patterns and insights using Tableau
- ✅ Cleaned & prepared raw data using Python
